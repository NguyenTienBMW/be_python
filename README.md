Call Python Script from Node JS


Node.js is one of the most adopted web development technologies but it lacks support for machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence libraries. Luckily, Python supports all these and many more other features. Django Framework for Python can utilize this functionality of Python and can provide support for building new age web application using machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

For those developers who are not familiar with Django Framework but use Node JS framework can also benefit from Python using child process module for Node JS.

Child Process module for Node JS provides functionality to run scripts or commands in languages other than JavaScript too (like Python). We can implement machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms and many features provided via Python library into Node JS application. Child Process allows us to run Python script in Node JS application and stream in/out data into/from Python script.

child_process.spawn(): This method helps us to spawn child process asynchronously.
